Aspiring Web and App Developer from India 🌐📱 Hello! I'm Pranav Murali, a Computer Science sophomore at VIT Vellore 🎓. I'm super into making websites and apps that look cool and work well.
🤝 Team Player: I like working with others. Teaming up with fellow creators, brainstorming ideas, and building stuff together is so much fun.
🎮 Beyond the Code: When I'm not coding, I'm probably gaming, chilling with a book or watching anime/series.
